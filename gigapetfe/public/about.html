          <p>We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. Use your imagination, let it go. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Let's build an almighty mountain. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.</p>
        </section>
        <section data-tab="card 2" class="pitem">
          <p>We can fix anything. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. Just make little strokes like that. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Isn't that fantastic? This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.</p>
        </section>
        <section data-tab="card 3" class="pitem">
          <p>We'll put a happy little sky in here. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. All kinds of happy little splashes. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Zip. That easy.</p>
        </section>
        <section data-tab="card 4" class="pitem">
          <p>Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that.</p>
