      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

          <p>Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.</p>

            <p>And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. It is a lot of fun. </p>

            <p>It's cold, but it's beautiful. You can spend all day playing with mountains. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Very easy to work these to death. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. </p>

          <img src="images/veggies.jpg" alt="vegetables" class="citem active-img" data-food="food1">

          <img src="images/dairy.jpg" alt="dairy" class="citem" data-food="food4">
        </ul>

        <p>And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Trees grow however makes them happy.</p>
