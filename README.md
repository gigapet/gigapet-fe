#### Don't **Fork** the Repo
- every frontend/UI developer will be working on this repo, but on separate branches.

- after git cloning THIS repo, do:
   
    - you may need to `git pull` before creating a new branch
   
    - `git branch [firstname-lastname]` <-----  creates the branch with your first and last name as branch name 
     
    - `git checkout [firstname-lastname]` <---- switches your working directory into your newly created branch
    
    - `git push -u origin [firstname-lastname]` <--pushes that branch to github

        - subsequent pushes after the above push can be done with `git push [firstname-lastname]`
    
    you can then `git commit` into that branch wth all your changes.


- you still need to run `yarn install` to get your node_modules
